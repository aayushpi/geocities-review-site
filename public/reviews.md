### Andor
**Type:** TV  
**Hot:** true

Andor is a television rarity: It's determined, confident, and focused in a sprawling and often messy StarWars universe. It's characters are convincing, and together tell a tale of manufactured consent, class struggle, and overreach in a smart, and truly accessible way. The ending broke my heart.
