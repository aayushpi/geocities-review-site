## 🎬 Films

### The Matrix
**Type:** Film  
**Hot:** true

Whoa! This movie totally blew my mind! The special effects are absolutely revolutionary and Keanu Reeves is so cool as Neo. The whole concept of reality being a simulation is just incredible.

### Blade Runner
**Type:** Film  

This movie is absolutely mind-blowing! The visual effects are incredible and the story is so deep. Harrison Ford is perfect as Deckard and the whole cyberpunk aesthetic is just amazing.

## 📺 TV Shows

### Andor
**Type:** TV  
**Hot:** true

Andor is a television rarity: It's determined, confident, and focused in a sprawling and often messy StarWars universe. It's characters are convincing, and together tell a tale of manufactured consent, class struggle, and overreach in a smart, and truly accessible way. The ending broke my heart.

## 🎮 Games

### Super Mario 64
**Type:** Game  

This game is amazing! The 3D graphics are mind-blowing and controlling Mario in 3D feels so natural. Princess Peach's castle is like the coolest hub world ever created.

## 📚 Books

### Neuromancer
**Type:** Book  

William Gibson is a genius! This cyberpunk masterpiece predicted the internet before it even existed. The writing style is so cool and futuristic.
