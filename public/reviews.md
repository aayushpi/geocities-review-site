### Rogue One
**Type:** Film  

Watching Rogue One after Andor, without having seen any of the other Star Wars films might not be the primary persona of this film. But it did provide a fitting, meaningful end to a beloved character and maintaned a tension that I felt through most of the show preceeding it. Enjoyable, even if not at the breathless heights of its prequel.

### Martyr!
**Type:** Book  
**Hot:** true

I found Kaveh Akbar's book to be a timely read last year, it's even more important now. Knowing your roots, your people, and yourself is a struggle and his depiction of Cyrus' journey through it moved me. One of the better books of my lifetime.

### The Seep
**Type:** Book  
**Hot:** true

Chana Porter's novella is a beautiful reflection on memory, form, permanance, and loss. "Tips for Attending a Dinner Party When Your World Has Ended and Another World Is Just Beginning" also might be one of the most heart warming openings to a book I've read in a while. When I think about this book, I think about the great losses in my life -- my dogs, close ones -- and remember that my memory isn't just their passing but all the moments that led up to it.

### Weapons
**Type:** Film  
**Hot:** true

### Together

**Hot:** true

### Eddington
**Type:** Film  

### Andor
**Type:** TV  
**Hot:** true

Andor is a television rarity: It's determined, confident, and focused in a sprawling and often messy StarWars universe. It's characters are convincing, and together tell a tale of manufactured consent, class struggle, and overreach in a smart, and truly accessible way. The ending broke my heart.

### Star Trek: New Worlds
**Type:** TV  
**Hot:** true

### Clair Obscura 33
**Type:** Game  
**Hot:** true

### The Substance
**Type:** Film

The body horror was the male gaze all along.

### Monkey Man
**Type:** Film
**Hot:** true

Monkey Man expertly blended mythology, fascism, gender, and class struggle and deserved a lot more flowers. Zakir Hussain's cameo in the second act is perfect, a nod to classic Bollywood. Dev Patel in this (as in the Green Knight a few years ago) shines as an actor.

### The Curse
**Type:** TV
**Hot:** true

While the streaming era has been truly terrible for television, The Curse wouldn't exist without it. A consistent background hum of discomfort highlights this part-parody, part-reflection of HGTV-esque reality, with scattershot yet brilliant critiques of gentrification, white savior complex, the camera gaze, and so much more.


### Saga
**Type:** Book
**Hot:** true



A lavish Sci-Fi world with truly alien stages and extremely relatable characters. Read this to feel something.
